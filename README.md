# Phase 1 - Writing Your Own Loadable Kernel Module 

In this practice of the subject Administration and Systems Design we will program a driver for
control a bluetooth device that is needed for the testing server and keep it in good condition
business-wide print server. We will also adapt the system to the appropriate needs
from time to time, either by compiling the Kernel and adding new LKM (Linux kernel modules).

In the first phase of the practice we will see how an LKM can be added to control a small one
Raspberry Pi Zero board with auxiliary buttons to turn on and off 2 LEDs on a protoboard.
